# **BudgetWise**  

### **Overview**  
BudgetWise is an open-source tool designed to help users better understand and manage their expenses. It prioritizes **privacy** by using local processing with small language models (SLMs) to analyze credit card statement PDFs, extract transactions, and display insights in a user-friendly format.  

I am currently unable to actively develop this project but will monitor for issues and pull requests. Contributions are welcome and appreciated!
I have currently paused writing code myself on this project but will be monitoring for any contributions from others. I will continue developing this further once I have more bandwidth.
